Attendees: Peter Argent (PA) Jim James (JJ) Hannah Jones (HJ, Chair), Marcus Crisafi (MC, minute taker)

Chair's Summary: 
Last week we added Marcus to Github and got him on Trello. We also put the code through a converter but found lots of bugs.
This week will be dedicated to fixing any code that doesn't work. We will also need to set up Trello for the following
weeks sprints and setup a product and sprint backlog.


MC Summary:
I convertered all nessasry VB code into C#

PA Summary:
Helped out people on their own computers making sure things were on track and ensured Marcus knew how to use the converter. 


JJ Summary:
I went through and put everything in the same namespace, got rid of all System.Data references and removed any invisible code.


Information Updates/Reminders
=============================
* Last week was about converting and documenting the code
* This week we will use a sprint process over two weeks to fix
bugs and extend the project. (No bug fixing or extensions yet!)
* Help from an external consultant has been provided to help get
the code converted and working if that was not done.
* Everyone should have used toggl.com to track their time last
week. Also track time on tasks this week with Toggl.
* Tutor must be added to GitHub, Trello and Toggl.
* Slack will be used to show the changes in the Trello board
during the sprint of activity
* The Programming Help Desk ATC620 is *still* available to help us
with programming for this unit.

Meeting Start Time: 16:27
Decisions Needed
================
*  Motion by PA, seconded JJ: We've been code from an external source and it has less bugs in it 
that what we had orginally and we will use as we understand it better.

General Items
=============
* (JJ) The Trello board needs to be updated ready for the planned
Sprint process. In particular columns for project backlog and
sprint backlog will be needed.
* (JJ) Create and link the team slack so that we can be notified and
have a nice record of the Trello updates.
* (HJ / JJ) The project backlog of tasks needs to be created. Use the
existing bugs and features we have documented, and convert to the
required format. Need a meeting after this meeting to get that
done and into Trello (today).
* (HJ) Project backlog tasks need to be prioritised and their time
estimated using 1,2,4,8 hour categories. (Today)
* (HJ) The new Sprint backlog needs to be pre-selected ready for
discussion and approval with the project owner. (Today)
* Once Sprint has started, hold a daily scrum meeting. (Start next
week?)
* (PA, MC) Update code.
