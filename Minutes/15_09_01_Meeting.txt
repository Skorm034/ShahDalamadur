Meeting

Attendees: Peter Argent (PA, minute taker) Jim James (JJ, Chair) Hannah Jones (HJ), and new person Marcus Crisafi (MC)

Chair's Summary: 
Last week researched every thing, JJ's code would not work, continued using the git repo, and went and listed everything. Welcome to MC. Couldn't find any unused files

MC Summary:
Hello, and hope i have a role

PA:
Did small amount of research on vb.net to c#. Swingame has its c#. Created a list of things to add 

HJ:
Made a list of glaring problems, found on wiki

Information Updates/Reminders
=============================
* Last week was about analysing the legacy code.
* This week is about converting and documenting the code
* Next week we will use a sprint process over two weeks to fix
bugs and extend the project. (No bug fixing or extensions yet!)
* Everyone should be able to use the team git repo, github wiki’s
and Trello. Ask for help (tutor or team) if that’s a problem.
* Everyone should have used toggl.com to track their time last
week. Also track time on tasks this week with Toggl.
* Tutor must be added to github, trello and toggl.
* The Programming Help Desk ATC620 is *still* available to help us
with programming for this unit.


Meeting Start 1548

Decisions Needed
================
* What tool(s) will be used to do the conversion, based on the
report?
Use Telerik (Motion PA, Second HJ, passed unianimously)
When we convert take C# swingame template and drop there.

* What coding standard will be used for C#, based on the report?
PascalCase for Method Name; camelCase for fields and variables; _ before fields

General Items
=============
* Add tutor account to team tools (github, wiki, toggle) (JJ)
* Code needs to be converted, and the converted code committed to
the repository. (Note – repository must start with VB code.) (PA, MC)
* Converted code will need the appropriate SwinGame files to build
and run the C# code. (MC)
* Missing code documentation (identified by report) needs to be
fixed in the converted code. Can be shared by several people (JJ, HJ)
* Converted and running code functionality needs to be checked to
make sure it is the same as before (Validation). Suggest a
checklist (list of functions?) to document the before and after
result. (HJ)
* There may be missing features, bugs or extension ideas that have
not been identified and documented. This will be needed for the
up-coming two-week sprint, so we should continue to look for these
and note what they are. (Everyone)
